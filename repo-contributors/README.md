## memo
It was rainy Sunday night and I had nothing to do so I had some fun looking at what's happening in "[what is code ?](https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode)" repo just to entertain myself for writing commentary _[What I learned from reading PRs and issues on 'What is Code?' repo](https://gist.github.com/kosamari/8567efdbce07d4af6d1b)_

## dependencies
requests: `pip install requests`

## sample output
Sample output from BloombergMedia/whatiscode is in `users.csv`
